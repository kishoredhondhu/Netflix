Consistency: Ensure consistent padding and margins throughout the application. The content area on the "Dashboard" feels a bit tighter to the edges than the "Create Project" form.
Visual Hierarchy: Use typography (different font sizes and weights) more effectively to guide the user's eye. For example, the "Create Movie Project" heading could be slightly larger or bolder.
Sidebar: Consider adding icons next to "Dashboard" and "Create Project" for quicker visual identification. If you plan to add more sections, ensure the sidebar can handle them gracefully (perhaps with scrolling or sub-menus).
Feedback: Implement visual feedback for user actions. For example, show a success message (a "toast" or "snackbar") when a project is created, and loading indicators if data takes time to load.
Spacing & Grouping: Add slightly more vertical spacing between form fields for better readability. Consider grouping related fields using subtle borders or section headings (e.g., "Project Details," "Timeline," "Team")
Genre Selection: If a movie can have multiple genres, consider using a multi-select dropdown or a tag-input field instead of a single-select dropdown.Budget Input: For the "Budget" field, you could implement input masking or formatting to ensure users enter numbers correctly and perhaps allow for different currencies if needed.
"Use Template" Clarity: The "Use Template" checkbox is a bit ambiguous.
Consider changing it to a toggle switch for a more modern feel.
Add a small help icon ( ? ) or a sub-text explaining what using a template does (e.g., "Pre-fills common tasks and team roles").
If there are multiple templates, this should likely be a dropdown or a selection modal.
"Create Project" Button: Make it slightly more prominent. Ensure it provides a disabled state if required fields are not filled in.
Dashboard" Table Improvements:

Actions: This is crucial. Users will need to interact with the projects. Add an "Actions" column with icons or a menu button (e.g., "...") for each row, allowing users to:
View Details: Go to a dedicated page for that project.
Edit: Open the "Create Project" form pre-filled with the project data.
Delete: Remove the project (with a confirmation step).
Clickable Rows: Consider making the entire row (or at least the 'Title') clickable to navigate to the project's details page.
Team Display: The current "Team" column only shows one name. How will multiple members be displayed?
Count: Show a number (e.g., "5 Members") and reveal the list on hover/click.
Avatars: Show small profile pictures/initials of a few members.
List (if short): Show a comma-separated list (might get long).
Template Column: "No" is functional, but "Yes/No" could be replaced with icons (like a checkmark/cross) or a toggle-like visual for quicker scanning.
Data Formatting: Ensure consistent formatting for Budget (e.g., â‚¹20,000) and Dates.
Sorting & Filtering: As the list grows, users will need to sort by columns (add sort icons to headers) and potentially filter/search the list (add a search bar above the table).
Pagination: If you expect many projects, implement pagination at the bottom of the table.
Empty State: What does the dashboard look like when there are no projects? Show a helpful message and perhaps a prominent "Create New Project" button.
Advanced Suggestions:
Dashboard Widgets: Instead of just a table, the dashboard could include summary widgets or charts (e.g., "Projects in Production," "Upcoming Deadlines," "Budget Overview").
Drag-and-Drop: If you implement a more detailed project view with tasks, consider drag-and-drop functionality for task management (Kanban-style).
Real-time Updates: Use technologies like WebSockets to update the dashboard or project details in real-time if multiple users are collaborating.
